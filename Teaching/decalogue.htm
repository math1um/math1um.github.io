<h2>
A LIBERAL DECALOGUE</h2></center>

<center>
<h3>
By Bertrand Russell</h3></center>
Perhaps the essence of the Liberal outlook could be summed up in a new
decalogue, not intended to replace the old one but only to supplement it.
The Ten Commandments that, as a teacher, I should wish to promulgate, might
be set forth as follows:
<p>&nbsp;1. Do not feel absolutely certain of anything.
<p>&nbsp;2. Do not think it worth while to proceed by concealing evidence,
for the evidence is sure to come to light.
<p>&nbsp;3. Never try to discourage thinking for you are sure to succeed.
<p>&nbsp;4. When you meet with opposition, even if it should be from your
husband or your children, endeavor to overcome it by argument and not by
authority, for a victory dependent upon authority is unreal and illusory.
<p>&nbsp;5. Have no respect for the authority of others, for there are
always contrary authorities to be found.
<p>&nbsp;6. Do not use power to suppress opinions you think pernicious,
for if you do the opinions will suppress you.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;7. Do not fear to be eccentric in opinion, for every opinion
now accepted was once eccentric.
<p>&nbsp;8. Find more pleasure in intelligent dissent that in passive agreement,
for, if you value intelligence as you should, the former implies a deeper
agreement than the latter.
<p>&nbsp;9. Be scrupulously truthful, even if the truth is inconvenient,
for it is more inconvenient when you try to conceal it.
<p>&nbsp;10. Do not feel envious of the happiness of those who live in
a fool's paradise, for only a fool will think that it is happiness.
