	<h4>Biographical</h4>
<p>
	I am originally from California. My
	<a href="momx.html">mom</a> is German and my
	<a href="dad-hume3.jpg">dad</a> is Chicagoan. I have a
	<a href="kev-lincoln-small.jpg">younger brother</a>
	<a href="cousins.html">Kevin</a> (he's a researcher at Microsoft now). Dad was an aerospace engineer (he worked on Skylab, Shuttle, and the Space Station, among other things) and taught us a lot of math when we were kids. We grew up in
	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huntington_Beach,_California">Huntington Beach</a>, where  I still have a lot of
	<a href="friends.html">buddies</a>. I grew up a huge fan of the
	Los Angeles Dodgers, and
	the Boston Celtics (which was a little awkward). I'm still a huge fan of both.
<p>
	I attended <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mater_Dei_High_School_(Santa_Ana,_California)">Mater Dei High School</a> I was a
	<a href="vice-president.html">Congressional Page</a>, ran cross country and track (I ran a 4:50 mile as a sophomore), and was pretty geeky. I went to the
	<a href="http://www.uh.edu">University of Houston</a> on a National Merit scholarship. In college I studied philosophy as well as math, and have advanced degrees in both. I taught for many years in the math department at the
	University of Houston, where I won a
	<a href="http://www.uh.edu/uhtoday/2006/facultyawards/050306clarson.html">teaching award</a>, and met my beautiful
	<a href="wedding-pic.jpg">wife</a> Jeanine. I was also a member of Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity's Epsilon Omicron chapter, and later the faculty advisor.
<p>
	Jeanine and I are both big
	<a href="desert_island_discs.html">music</a> fans and
	<a href="gloria.pdf">cat lovers</a>. We like to run, bike,
	<a href="ireland-2007.pdf">travel</a>,
	<a href="books.html">read</a>, eat, see bands,
	<a href="movies.html">movies</a> and the
	ballet. We have a little guy, <a href="linus-graph-theory.JPG">Linus Carl Larson</a>, with us in our adventures. And now I'm at
	<a href="http://www.math.vcu.edu/">VCU</a>, where I've also won a <a href="https://intranet.chs.vcu.edu/faculty-affairs/awards/annual-faculty-awards/">teaching award</a>.
<p>
	My
	research currently involves
	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory">graph theory</a>,
	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorial_optimization">combinatorial optimization</a> and
	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence">artificial intelligence</a>; but I'm interested in many many many things. In the spring of 2012, I was at <a href="http://tinyurl.com/coy4snh">Texas A&M University, Galveston</a>, working with, and learning from  <a href="http://hrcak.srce.hr/file/166599">Doug Klein</a>, a theoretical chemist and chemical graph theorist, and in Spring 2013, I was at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Ghent">Ghent University,  Belgium</a>, as a <a href="http://has.vcu.edu/larson/">Fulbright Research Scholar</a>, working with Gunnar Brinkmann, an expert in graph algorithms and graph generation.
<p>
	I've been really lucky to learn from great, smart and inspiring advisors. These include <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Leiber">Justin Leiber</a> (Philosophy M.A.), <a href="http://www.math.uh.edu/~siemion/">Siemion Fajtlowicz</a> (Math M.S.), <a href="http://cms.dt.uh.edu/faculty/delavinae/">Ermelinda Delavina</a> & <a href="http://www.math.uh.edu/~klaus/">Klaus Kaiser</a> (Math Ph.D.), <a href="http://hrcak.srce.hr/file/166599">Doug Klein</a> (TAMUG), and <a href="http://lib.ugent.be/bibliografie/801001807792">Gunnar Brinkmann</a> (Ghent). Here's my <a href="larson-math-geneology.pdf">mathematical geneology<a>.

	I am a member of <a href = "https://heterodoxacademy.org">Heterodox Academy</a> which aims to "improve the quality of research and education in universities by
	increasing viewpoint diversity, mutual understanding, and constructive
	disagreement." (I follow <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Liberty">John Stuart Mill</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitney_v._California#Brandeis's_concurrence">Justice Brandeis</a> on the importance of engagement and discussion).
	I am also a member of American Association of University Professors (<a href="https://www.aaup.org/about-aaup">AAUP</a>), and the Faculty Network of the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (<a href="https://www.thefire.org/about-us/mission/">FIRE</a>), whose mission is to defend and sustain the individual rights of students and faculty members at America's colleges and universities.

	<h4>NSA Statement</h4>
	<p>
	I do not accept grant money from the NSA,
	I do not do any work for the NSA, including refereeing grant proposals.
	The NSA is a dangerous and anti-democratic organization.
	Here is what Senator Church (D-ID) said about the NSA in 1975:
	<blockquote>
		<p>
	"In the need to develop a capacity to know what potential enemies are doing, the United States government has perfected a technological capability that enables us to monitor the messages that go through the air. (...)
	Now, that is necessary and important to the United States as we look abroad
	at enemies or potential enemies. We must know, at the same time, that
	capability at any time could be turned around on the American people,
	and no American would have any privacy left such is the capability to
	monitor everything-telephone conversations, telegrams, it doesn't matter.
	There would be no place to hide.
	<p>
	If this government ever became a tyranny, if a dictator ever took charge in
	this country, the technological capacity that the intelligence community
	has given the government could enable it to impose total tyranny, and
	there would be no way to fight back because the most careful effort to
	combine together in resistance to the government, no matter how privately
	it was done, is within the reach of the government to know. Such is the
	capability of this technology. (...)
<p>
	I don't want to see this country ever go across the bridge.
	I know the capacity that is there to make tyranny total in America,
	and we must see to it that this agency and all agencies that possess
	this technology operate within the law and under proper supervision so
	that we never cross over that abyss. That is the abyss from which there
	is no return."
	</blockquote>
