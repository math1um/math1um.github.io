This is me and my buddy David Parker prior to President Ronald 
Reagan's 1985 State of the Union Address. I am in the Vice-President's 
(George H. W. Bush's) chair. Dave is in the Speaker of the House's 
(Tip O'Neil's) chair. Cameras are not normally allowed on the House 
floor or in the Gallery  -- we managed to get a wire service 
photographer to take this picture. In the 200 year history of 
Congressional Pages, 
this is the only known picture of pages seated on the Speaker's dais.
